# An example of a pattern one might use for Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium
# queries upon 1,000 Genomes variants.  It is specifically computing
# the Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium for the variants found in BRCA1 and
# then computing the chi-squared score for the observed versus
# expected counts for the calls.
