bigquery-examples
=================

The data stories and queries in this repository demonstrate working with genomic data via [Google BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/).  All examples are built upon public datasets.

Have other data stories you would like to see here?  Have any data stories you would like to *share*?  Have *corrections to the biology* covered in this material?  Have query *simplifications* or *speed improvements*?  Let us know by [filing an issue](https://github.com/googlegenomics/bigquery-examples/issues) or [contacting us directly](mailto:google-genomics-contact@googlegroups.com).

Getting Started
-----------------

If you are new to BigQuery, start here instead: [Analyze Variants Using BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/genomics/v1/analyze-variants).

Otherwise, navigate through the tree of content in this repository.  You will find queries, RMarkdown, rendered analyses, and provenance details.

Loading your own Variant Data into BigQuery
-------------------------------------------

After trying these queries on public data, you can [load your own variant data into BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/genomics/v1/load-variants).

For other types of data, such as variant annotations, see [Preparing Data for BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/preparing-data-for-bigquery) and also [BigQuery in Practice : Loading Data Sets That are Terabytes and Beyond](https://cloud.google.com/developers/articles/bigquery-in-practice) for more detail.

The mailing list
----------------

The [Google Genomics Discuss mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/google-genomics-discuss) is a good
way to sync up with other people who use googlegenomics including the core developers. You can subscribe
by sending an email to ``google-genomics-discuss+subscribe@googlegroups.com`` or just post using
the [web forum page](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/google-genomics-discuss).
