Annotations
============

Tute Genomics has provided a table of annotations for hg19 SNPs.

* For example queries, see  the [Platinum Genomes Annotation JOINs](../platinumGenomes)
data story for a few examples of how these tables can be used with variant data.
* Please see [Google Genomics Public Data](http://googlegenomics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/use_cases/discover_public_data/tute_genomics_public_data.html)
for more detail.

A handful of other annotation databases have been loaded to BigQuery for
prototyping purposes.  See [provenance](./provenance) for details on the
source of this data and how it may have been transformed prior to loading
to BigQuery.
